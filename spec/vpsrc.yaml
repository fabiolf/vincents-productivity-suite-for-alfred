# This is a sample configuration file, that also serves as documentation.
# The general approach  is that there are defaults for everything. The simplest
# configuration looks like this:
#
#   areas:
#     family:
#       bear:
#       omnifocus:
#       contacts:
#
# This sets up a single area called 'Family' with:
# - Root directory ~/Family
# - Bear notes
# - OmniFocus projects from the folder 'Family'
# - Contacts people from the group 'Family'.
areas:
  work:
    # No name specified; the default is the key, capitalized. I.e. 'Work'
    bear:
      tags:
        - Work/Journal/$year/$month/$date
    omnifocus:
      folder: 'Professional life'
    contacts:
      group: 'Business associates'
    wallpaper:
      path: 'work.jpg'

  personal:
    name: 'Personal Stuff'
    root: '~/Personal'
    bear:
      # Nothing specified here, so all defaults apply:
      # tags: []
    omnifocus:
      # Nothing specified here, so the defaults apply:
      # folder: 'Personal Stuff' (the name of the area)
    contacts:
      # Nothing specified here, so the defaults apply:
      # group: 'Personal Stuff' (the name of the area)
      mail:
        from: 'Me Myself <me@example.com>'
    # No "wallpaper" specified, so nothing happens when focusing on this area.

# The optional actions section describes the things to do whenever the focus changes.
# If this section is not available, nothing special happens.
actions:
  wallpaper:
    # Nothing specified here, so the defaults apply:
    # path: '/Library/Desktop Pictures/High Sierra.jpg'
  bitbar:
    # Nothing specified here, so the defaults apply:
    # plugin: 'focused-area'
  omnifocus:
    # The OmniFocus action has no further settings
