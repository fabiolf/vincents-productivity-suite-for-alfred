# This is a sample configuration file, that also serves as documentation.
# The general approach  is that there are defaults for everything. The simplest
# configuration looks like this:
#
#   areas:
#     family:
#       markdown-notes:
#
# This sets up a single area called 'Family' with:
# - Root directory ~/Family
# - Markdown notes in ~/Family/Notes
areas:
  work:
    # No name specified; the default is the key, capitalized. I.e. 'Work'
    markdown-notes:
      path: 'Notes'
      editor: 'open -a Byword.app'
      extension: 'markdown'
      # Fields available in the name template:
      # - $year
      # - $month
      # - $week
      # - $day
      # - $title
      # - $safe_title: the title, usable in filenames
      # - $slug: title in lower case, spaces replaced by hyphens
      name-template: '$year/Week $week/$year-$month-$day/$safe_title'
      file-template: |
        ---
        date: $day-$month-$year
        slug: $slug
        ---
        # $title
    omnifocus:
      folder: 'Work'
  personal:
    name: 'Personal Stuff'
    root: '~/Personal'
    markdown-notes:
      # Nothing specified here, so all defaults apply:
      # path: 'Notes'
      # extension: 'md'
      # editor: 'open'
      # name-template: '$year-$month-$day-$slug'
      # file-template: |
      #   ---
      #   date: $day-$month-$year
      #   ---
      #   # $title
      #
    omnifocus:
      # Nothing specified here, so the defaults apply:
      # folder: 'Personal Stuff' (the name of the area)
