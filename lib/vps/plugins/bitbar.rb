    ##
    # Action plugin to set a label in BitBar for the focused area whenever the focus changes.
    #
    # The label to show must be set in the +bitbar+ section of the area configuration.
    # It defaults to the name of the area. Tip: use emoji's as labels. They show up like icons.
    #
    # The BitBar action itself can be configured with the name of the plugin that must be refreshed
    # by BitBar. By default this is +focused-area.1d.rb+, which is the name of the plugin as it
    # exists in this application.
    #
    # == Minimal configuration
    #
    #   actions:
    #     bitbar:
    #
    # This will set the label in BitBar to the name of each area.
    #
    # == Extended configuration sample
    #
    #   areas:
    #     myarea:
    #       bitbar:
    #         label: 'üëç'
    #   actions:
    #     bitbar:
    #       plugin: 'focus.1d.rb'
    #
    # This triggers the plugin +focus.1d.rb+ whenever the focus changes. The label for the
    # area +myarea+ is set to a thumbs up.
